# L1
L1 has differences from L2. Everything is now a statement, and not a terms. The following functions were added
* copy
* halt

The following were removed
* let
* begin
* reference

The new functions allows a function to stop at a given moment, copy allows variables to copy the data from an another variable.

Some functions were also modified, these are
* abstract
* immediate
* primitive
* branch
* allocate
* load
* store

All of these function now have a `then`, which allows the function to proceed to the next statement, this is a fundenmetnal change of how the language behaves from L2.
